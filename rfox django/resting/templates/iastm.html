        <h2>What is Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Massage (IASTM)?</h2>
        <p>Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Massage (IASTM) is a technique that involves using specialized tools to treat soft tissue injuries, reduce muscle tension, and improve mobility. This method is designed to target fascial restrictions, break down scar tissue, and promote healing in muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The tools used in IASTM are typically made of stainless steel or other durable materials and allow for precise application of pressure.</p>

    <div class="benefits">
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scar Tissue Breakdown</strong>: Effectively breaks down scar tissue and adhesions, promoting tissue health and flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Mobility</strong>: Improves range of motion by addressing fascial restrictions and soft tissue tension.</li>
            <li><strong>Pain Relief</strong>: Reduces pain from chronic conditions, muscle tension, and overuse injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Accelerated Healing</strong>: Stimulates blood flow and tissue regeneration, aiding in faster recovery from injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Athletic Performance</strong>: Helps athletes by reducing muscle tightness and preventing injuries.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="for_who">
        <h3>Who Would Benefit?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individuals with Chronic Pain or Soft Tissue Injuries</strong>: Especially those with conditions like tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, or muscle strains.</li>
            <li><strong>Athletes</strong>: Those who need to recover from injuries quickly or want to prevent potential muscle or soft tissue injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>People with Limited Mobility or Stiffness</strong>: Beneficial for those experiencing restricted movement due to fascial tension or scar tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Surgical Patients</strong>: Helps in breaking down post-surgical scar tissue and improving mobility.</li>
        </ul>
