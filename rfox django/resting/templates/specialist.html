        <h2>What is Deep Tissue/Sports Massage?</h2>
        <p>Deep tissue and sports massages are therapeutic techniques focused on targeting deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue. While they share similarities, they are often used in different contexts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong> involves applying sustained pressure using slow, deep strokes to reach deeper muscle layers and fascia. It is primarily used to address chronic muscle pain, tension, and injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Sports Massage</strong> is designed for athletes and physically active individuals. It incorporates techniques from deep tissue massage but also includes stretching and other methods to enhance athletic performance, prevent injuries, and aid in recovery.</li>
        </ul>
