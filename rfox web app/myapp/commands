I opted for the Deep tissue massage, and it exceeded my expectations. Daniel, was amazing, using a perfect mix of gentle and firm techniques. The heated massage table and tranquil decor enhanced the entire experience.

After the session, I felt incredibly rejuvenated and stress-free. I highly recommend The Resting Fox Massage for anyone seeking a high-quality, relaxing massage. I cant wait for my next visit!' WHERE id = 2;
